## Approximations

This sub-section contains approximations to famous
constants.

### Pi

**Spigot algorithms**:

Two algorithms were discovered in 1995 that opened up new avenues of research into $π$. They are called [spigot algorithms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spigot_algorithm) because, like water dripping from a [spigot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_(valve)), they produce single digits of π that are not reused after they are calculated. This is in contrast to infinite series or iterative algorithms, which retain and use all intermediate digits until the final result is produced.


Another spigot algorithm, the [BBP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula) [digit extraction algorithm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_extraction_algorithm), was discovered in 1995 by Simon Plouffe:

$$ {\displaystyle \pi =\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{\frac {1}{16^{k}}}\left({\frac {4}{8k+1}}-{\frac {2}{8k+4}}-{\frac {1}{8k+5}}-{\frac {1}{8k+6}}\right)} $$


### Speed of light

In classical physics, light is described as a type of electromagnetic wave. The classical behaviour of the electromagnetic field is described by Maxwell's equations, which predict that the speed c with which electromagnetic waves (such as light) propagate in vacuum is related to the distributed capacitance and inductance of vacuum, otherwise respectively known as the electric constant $\varepsilon _{0}$ and the magnetic constant $\mu _{0}$, by the equation._

$$\displaystyle c={\frac {1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon _{0}\mu _{0}}}\.}$$ _
