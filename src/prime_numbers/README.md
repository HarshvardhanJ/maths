# Prime numbers

This sub-section is for all my notes and programs for prime numbers that I made while studying about them.


1. `primes.go` => Contains functions for checking if a number is prime or not and prime number approximations.

2. `primes.py` => Contains functions for checking prime numbers in fibonacci series.
