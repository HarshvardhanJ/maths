This repo is a part of my main repo [`notes`](https://github.com/Sarthak2143/notes).

*"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beautyâ€”a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show."*
