# Maths

This is an archive where I'll be saving my work on math using programming. This repo contains some solutions of mathematical algorithms implemented.

This repo is a part of my main repo [`notes`](https://github.com/Sarthak2143/notes).

*"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beautyâ€”a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show."*
